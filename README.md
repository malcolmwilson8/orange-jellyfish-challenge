# Orange Jellyfish Challenge

## What is the purpose of this repo?

This repo houses my response to the Orange Jellyfish Challenge issued through Founders and Coders. It contains: 
 - This README outlining the challenge scenario 
 - Mockup imagery
 - GitHub Issues which explain my approach to the challenge

## Task

As a software developer for an e-commerce site, my team is working on a new web application which will allow customers to complete their shopping online.

For this app, I need to deliver the following frontend functionality:

<em>"We need to display our products on a page for customers to view. They should be able to add and
remove these products from their shopping basket.</em>

<em>The backend team have just completed work on a 'getProducts' API which will return product
information from the database."</em>

I have a mockup image for the app (below) which I will use, along with the above information, to break the business requirements down into a series of tasks (via GitHub Issues) for the development team to work through.

Things to consider:
- Is there any further information that you as a developer require from the business before starting the development work?
- Think about potential errors that could occur when this new functionality is running in production, how would you handle/mitigate these?

## Mockup

The mockup contains a number of standout elements. Listing these elements reveals features which will need to be worked on:

- A search field
