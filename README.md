## What is the purpose of this repo?

This repo houses my response to the Orange Jellyfish Challenge issued through Founders and Coders bootcamp. It contains: 
 - This README outlining the challenge scenario 
 - Mockup imagery
 - GitHub Issues which explain my approach to the challenge

## Task

As a software developer for an e-commerce site, my team is working on a new web application which will allow customers to complete their shopping online.

For this app, I need to deliver the following frontend functionality:

<em>"We need to display our products on a page for customers to view. They should be able to add and
remove these products from their shopping basket.</em>

<em>The backend team have just completed work on a 'getProducts' API which will return product
information from the database."</em>

I have a mockup image for the app (below) which I will use, along with the above information, to break the business requirements down into a series of tasks (via GitHub Issues) for the development team to work through.

Things to consider:
- Is there any further information that you as a developer require from the business before starting the development work?
- Think about potential errors that could occur when this new functionality is running in production, how would you handle/mitigate these?

## Mockup

The mockup contains a number of standout elements. Listing these elements reveals features which will need to be worked on:

- A search field, likely allowing users to look for other products on site
- A nav bar, with 'Home', 'About' and 'Help' links, as well as a 'Your Basket' link featuring a basket SVG style icon
- A 'Product Results' section; the most detailed part of the page. This section contains individual product images, names, prices and star ratings for 6 products
- A 'Basket' pane to the right of the page, featuring a basket icon. This would likely be updated with relevant product information as the user selects their products


## Approach

First off, I want to address the 'Things to consider' elements of the task.

<em>Is there any further information that you as a developer require from the business before starting the development work?</em>

There is a lot of further information that I would need from the business before starting any development work. In bullet points below, I will list these out:
- Are there any supplementary objectives that I need to deliver on in addition to the functionalities required?
    - This would be particularly important to find out, as it would determine any stretch targets, or extra functionality I could help provide outside of the listed requirements. It would be very useful to have these to mind before starting on the task so I know what I can push myself to achieve as an added bonus.

- What does the business expect from the web application by the end of my development work?
    - It is necessary to find out if I am only expected to deliver on a minimum viable product (MVP) version of the web application, or if I am being tasked with delivering the complete, production-ready solution. I would want to ask the business what exactly they expect from me, and I would do so within the context of the SMART framework (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Timebound).

- What time frame am I working to within the project?

- What tech stack, libraries and frameworks will I be using to complete the functionalities required? 
    - Alongside HTML, CSS and JS, it is worth asking this as there are different ways to approach the challenge from a framework and library perspective. For example, would we need to use React, Angular or Vue.js to work on the components and build of the page itself? Also, it is worth asking:
        - What version control software would I be using?
        - What package management software would the project use?
        - Are there any requirements outside of the frontend functionalities listed? I.e. will I need to work directly on the backend side of the application also?



<em>Think about potential errors that could occur when this new functionality is running in production, how would you handle/mitigate these?</em>
